We are excited to provide details on each task which will be conducted in the first year of the TREC RAG! üéâüéâ

# TASK 1: Retrieval Track (R)

- **Given**: Participants will be provided a list of topics and the complete MS MARCO V2.1 segment collection.
- **Task**: Provide back the run file containing the top relevant segments from the MS MARCO V2.1 segment collection for each individual topic. 
- **Notes**: The ‚ÄúR‚Äù track emulates the previous TREC-DL 2022/2023 tracks is for the IR audience, however, the main difference lies in using document segments from the MS MARCO V2.1 segment collection instead of the MS MARCO v2.0 passage collection.

# TASK 2: Augmented Generation Track (AG)

- **Given**: Participants will be provided a list of topics and top-k relevant retrieved segments mapped with the MS MARCO V2.1 segment collection.
- **Task**: Return the summarized answer ground based on the information available in the pre-determined list of top-k segments provided to the participant. 
- **Notes**: The AG track is for the NLP audience, focused on the generation output and quality. We provide the top-k retrieved segments, which allows the participants to focus on the RAG generation quality, by grounding on the set of chunks of segments, and generate an informative RAG summarized answer.

# TASK 3: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Track (RAG)

- **Given**: Participants will be provided a list of topics and both the MS MARCO v2.1 document and MS MARCO v2.1 segment collections. 
- **Task**: Return the summarized answer and ground based on information which you can either the MS MARCO v2.1 document or segment collection. Develop your own retrieval system to fetch relevant information from the MS MARCO v2.1 segment/document collection. You can use either our pre-determined segment collection or incorporate your own **chunking** technique with the MS MARCO v2.1 document collection. For evaluation, we ask each participant to map their chunk of segments with MS MARCO v2.1 segment collections.
- **Notes**: The RAG track is a mixture of above (R) and (AG) tracks. This setup mimics best the industrial RAG setup for the NLP+IR audience. We evaluate the summarized answer in multiple ways incorporating both grounding and evaluating fluency of the generated output.

There Are Some Guidelines To Follow\nby Kelly Mullen-McWilliams\nJuly 22, 2017\nI don\'t know about you, but I\'m personally super pumped for that perfect day in the admittedly far-off future when I throw that last diaper away ‚Äî and then throw myself a party. If you\'re currently in the midst of toilet training, I salute you, and I also know you have a lot of questions. Whether it\'s going well or not, you\'re probably wondering things like, " how often should I take my toddler to the potty ?"\nMore Like This\nVaccinated People Can Ditch Masks. Where Does That Leave Kids?\n25 Real-Life Reasons Not To Trust Older Siblings Around The Baby\nMoms To Toddlers Everywhere: This Aggression Will Not Stand, Man\nHow 20 Kids Brought The Pandemic Into Their Play Worlds\nWhat Parents Are Talking About ‚Äî Delivered Straight To Your Inbox\nSubscribe\nAccording to an article in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), independent toilet use is a major milestone for your child, combining new physical capabilities with an understanding of social expectations, and their own motivation to become more autonomous. The article noted that toilet training is also one of the most difficult milestones for children and their parents, and that it can become highly emotional. Self-esteem can be fragile at this time, so it\'s important to toilet train gently, letting your child lead the way. Additionally, it\'s unwise to begin potty training unless your child is truly ready. Take this potty training readiness quiz featured in Parents before you begin.\nElizabeth Pantley, author of The No-Cry Potty Training Solution, explained in an excerpt on Child Development Info that most toddlers pee four to eight times per day. On top of that, toddlers have one or two bowel movements a day. But every toddler is an individual. Some will go more often than that, and others will last a couple days without having a bowel movement at all.\nIn terms of actually getting your toddler to the potty, Pantley suggested setting up a potty routine. Potty first thing in the morning, after eating, and before other activities, like riding in the car or going to sleep. Of course, you can adapt this routine to your lifestyle, and you still must be on the lookout for signs your toddler has to go ahead of schedule. If he or she looks squirmy, take them to the potty. But if you miss the signal, and there\'s a mess, it\'s no big deal. Practice makes perfect, after all. Don\'t let emotions get the better of you, even if your little girl or guy pees on an expensive piece of furniture.\nTry to get your toddler to the toilet frequently, but remember that it\'s OK if she needs a day off. According to Becoming the Parent You Want To Be by Laura Davis and Janis Keyser, it\'s common for children to go back and forth ‚Äî somedays preferring diapers, and other days selecting to use the toilet. They recommended thinking of "accidents" as "opportunities."\nPantley also suggested visiting new restrooms when you\'re on the go. Frequent visits to toilets far and near may help habituate your child to independent toilet use. Keep in mind that not all children will want to use strange bathrooms, and don\'t force anything. Davis and Keyser stressed the importance of keeping your own emotions in check throughout the toilet training process.\nThe bottom line: when it comes to potty time, there\'s no magic number, but it\'s a good idea to take your toddler to the toilet often. Begin by following a schedule ‚Äî morning pee, before nap time pee ‚Äî and remember to look for signs that they\'re holding it. You can only take your child to the bathroom too much if it begins to feel stressful or punitive. If negative emotions attach themselves to toilet time, it\'s OK to take a break. It might take some time to achieve that no-more-diapers party, but that\'s fine. You\'ll just have that much longer to plan a good one.\nMay 27. 2021\nSEARCH CLOSE\nPregnancy\nSee All Trying Birth After\nRaising Kids\nSee All Baby Toddler Little Kid Big Kid\nYou\nSee All Sex & Relationships Wellness Style\nLife\nSee All Food Home Entertainment Politics Shopping\nHealth\nAbout Archive Terms Privacy Newsletter Archive Advertise Masthead Editorial Standards\n¬© 2021 Bustle Digital Group.

Additionally, it's unwise to begin potty training unless your child is truly ready. Take this potty training readiness quiz featured in Parents before you begin. Elizabeth Pantley, author of The No-Cry Potty Training Solution, explained in an excerpt on Child Development Info that most toddlers pee four to eight times per day. On top of that, toddlers have one or two bowel movements a day. But every toddler is an individual. Some will go more often than that, and others will last a couple days without having a bowel movement at all. In terms of actually getting your toddler to the potty, Pantley suggested setting up a potty routine. Potty first thing in the morning, after eating, and before other activities, like riding in the car or going to sleep. Of course, you can adapt this routine to your lifestyle, and you still must be on the lookout for signs your toddler has to go ahead of schedule.",
