> **NEW** The TREC 2024 RAG deadline has been extended to August 25th 2024 (AoE)! :star:

The TREC 2024 RAG schedule has been, for the most part, finalized.
Below are the key dates and milestones for participants to note. 
Make sure to mark these dates on your calendar!

```
Development Topics and baselines released: June 2024
Final Topics released: August 4th, 2024
Submission deadline: August 25th, 2024 (AoE)
Results and judgments returned to participants: October 2024
TREC 2024 Conference: November 2024
```

Note that we have human assessments so the results take a bit longer to return to participants.
We encourage all participants to start preparing early and build out systems  with the initial development topics.
Where we’re going, we don’t need roads—just great submissions!

Cheers,

The TREC 2024 RAG Organizers
