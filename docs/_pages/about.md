Our [white paper](/assets/pdf/mm_track.pdf) will be released soon!

The [(TREC)](https://trec.nist.gov/) **R**etrieval-**A**ugmented **G**eneration Track is intended to foster innovation and research within the field of retrieval-augmented generation systems. This area of research focuses on combining retrieval methods - techniques for finding relevant information within large corpora with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the ability of systems to produce relevant, accurate, updated and contextually appropriate content.
